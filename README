Online Corpus Analyzer
======================

My website will soon be offline. I've migrated the front page to github pages
and the blog to tumblr. But there is no where for the Corpus Analyser to go.

Therefore, I am putting a standalone version of it here on github. The
only dependency is web.py.

Type `python start.py` or just `./start.py` to run the application.
